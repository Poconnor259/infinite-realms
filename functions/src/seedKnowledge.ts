## Dice Rolling
- d20: Primary resolution die for skill checks and attacks
- d4-d12: Variable damage dice based on weapons/spells
- Modifiers: Stats, proficiency, and situational bonuses

## Combat Flow
1. Initiative: Determines turn order
2. Action Phase: Move, Attack, Cast Spell, or Use Item
3. Resolution: Roll to hit, calculate damage, apply effects
4. Status Update: Track HP changes, conditions, cooldowns

## State Management
- Always track: HP, Resources (Mana/Stamina/Energy), Inventory
- Update incrementally: Only change what the action affects
- Validate bounds: HP cannot exceed max, resources have limits

## Skill Checks
- Base DC 10 (Easy), 15 (Medium), 20 (Hard), 25 (Very Hard)
- Roll = d20 + stat modifier + proficiency (if applicable)
- Natural 1 = Critical Failure, Natural 20 = Critical Success`

## Perspective
- Always use second person ("You walk...", "You see...")
- Keep the player as the protagonist
- NPCs speak in first person with distinct voices

## Scene Structure
- Opening: Set the scene, describe the environment
- Action: React to player input, describe consequences
- Tension: Build dramatic moments, use pacing
- Resolution: Provide clear outcomes, set up next beat

## Dialogue Writing
- Give NPCs personality through speech patterns
- Use dialects sparingly but effectively
- Actions in *italics*, spoken words in quotes
- Inner thoughts can be italicized

## Combat Narration
- Make attacks feel impactful
- Describe wounds without being gratuitous
- Keep combat flowing, avoid repetition
- Celebrate critical hits and critical failures

## Word Count
- Standard: 150-250 words
- Combat: Shorter, punchier
- Exploration: Can be more descriptive
- Dialogue-heavy: Let characters speak`

## When to Present Choices
1. Ambiguous situations (multiple valid interpretations)
2. Moral dilemmas or character-defining moments
3. Combat tactical decisions
4. Resource allocation (what to buy, use, or discard)
5. Dialogue branches with significant NPCs

## Choice Formatting
When presenting options:
- Use bullet points (•)
- Limit to 2-4 choices
- Make choices meaningfully different
- Include creative/unexpected options when appropriate

## Interpreting Player Intent
- "I attack" → Ask for target if multiple enemies
- "I search" → Automatically search the current area
- "I talk to him" → Begin dialogue, maybe ask tone
- "I use magic" → Ask for specific spell if multiple known

## Handling Failures
- Make failures interesting, not just "you fail"
- Failures can reveal information or new paths
- Critical failures should be memorable but fair
- Never punish creative thinking too harshly`
